# LED-project
Small project using NeoPixel WS2812 RBG LED strips and rpi_ws281x with a raspberry pi. Follow [this](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/connect-control-raspberry-pi-ws2812-rgb-led-strips/) tutorial for setting up the lights and installing rpi_ws281x.

This project currently only contains seperate scripts for each action, but I am working on a desktop/mobile GUI and socket for a more easy to use alternative.
